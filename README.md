# The Pupeteer
 A game I made as a project in my senior year of high school. I could clean up some of the code with my newfound knowledge. For example, I would make sure to close all the scanners I open and just use 1 for each class to reduce memory usage.
 I could also work to improve variable names so the code can be more easily understood.
